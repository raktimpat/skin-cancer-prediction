A full-stack, end-to-end machine learning project that classifies dermoscopic images of skin lesions into three medically relevant categories: **Benign**, **Melanoma**, and **Other Cancers**. This system is built using a multi-input PyTorch model and deployed on a serverless, cost-effective cloud architecture.

### üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The project follows a modern, scalable MLOps architecture designed for efficiency and low cost.



1.  **Frontend:** A user-friendly web interface built with **Streamlit** and deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
2.  **Backend:** A high-performance REST API built with **FastAPI** to serve model predictions.
3.  **Containerization:** The backend is containerized using **Docker** to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment.
4.  **Deployment:** The Docker container is pushed to **Google Artifact Registry** and deployed as a serverless service on **Google Cloud Run**.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Input Model:** Leverages both image data and tabular patient metadata (age, sex, localization) for more accurate predictions.
* **Deep Learning with PyTorch:** Utilizes a pretrained MobileNetV2 for transfer learning, optimized for performance on an low end hardware.
* **Serverless API:** A robust FastAPI backend capable of handling file uploads and JSON data, deployed on a scalable, pay-per-use infrastructure.
